2D and 3D phase unwrapping
==========================

This is a Python wrapper for 2D and 3D phase unwrapping code based on:

* (2D) M. A. Herr√°ez, D. R. Burton, M. J. Lalor, and M. A. Gdeisat, "Fast two-dimensional phase-unwrapping algorithm based on sorting by reliability following a noncontinuous path", `Applied Optics, Vol. 41, Issue 35, pp. 7437-7444 (2002) <http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/AO.41.007437>`_,
* (3D) H. Abdul-Rahman, M. Gdeisat, D. Burton, M. Lalor, "Fast three-dimensional phase-unwrapping algorithm based on sorting by reliability following a non-continuous path", `Proc. SPIE 5856, Optical Measurement Systems for Industrial Inspection IV, 32 (2005) <http://dx.doi.ogr/doi:10.1117/12.611415>`_.

More information about the code can be found on GERI homepage: `2D <http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/GERI/90207.htm>`_, `3D <http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/GERI/90208.htm>`_.
The general principle and applications are the same as those for a 1D ``unwrap`` `available in numpy <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.unwrap.html>`_.

Deprecation notice
------------------

This algorithm has also been included in `scikit-image <http://scikit-image.org>`_, derived from this (cython based) wrapper. I recommend using the scikit-image version due to better testing and additional bug fixes.

Installation
------------

The package is based on `cffi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cffi>`_ and requires it for installation. 
For some systems pre-built binary packages are available (see `unwrap <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unwrap>`_), 
for other systems that require building from source a C compiler is necessary.

::

    $ pip install cffi
    $ pip install unwrap

Usage
-----

The interface consists of a single function:

::

    >>> from unwrap import unwrap
    >>> unwrapped_array = unwrap(
    ...    wrapped_array,
    ...    wrap_around_axis_0=False,
    ...    wrap_around_axis_1=False,
    ...    wrap_around_axis_2=False)

It takes a 2- or 3-dimensional ``numpy`` array of floats, ``wrapped_array``, and returns
an array with the same shape with the values changed by integer
multiples of 2 pi such that the whole array has the least amount of
jumps. 

``wrapped_array`` can be a `masked array
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/maskedarray.generic.html>`_,
in this case masked entries are ignored during the phase unwrapping
process. This is useful if the wrapped phase data has holes or contains
invalid entries.

If the optional arguments ``wrap_around_axis_0`` etc. are set to
``True``, then phase unwrapping takes place also across the boundaries
of the specified axis, i.e., the first and last pixel along this axis
are assumed to be neighbours. 

Internally the wrapped array is converted to a C-contiguous array of
``np.float32``, therefor the unwrapped array also has this data type. 

Usage examples can be found in ``test/test_unwrap.py``.

People
------

The original C code by the authors mentioned above has been slightly modified by
Gregor Thalhammer for using it as a library. Bogdan Opanchuk changed
the Python wrapper to use `cffi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cffi>`_
instead of `Cython <http://cython.org>`_ and improved packaging.
